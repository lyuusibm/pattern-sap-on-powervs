# SAP on Power Virtual Server
{: #sap-on-powervs}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}

Figure 1 illustrates a high-level summary of the Use Case, an SAP Single-zone, multi-region deployment on IBM Cloud PowerVS.  The Primary Region supports regular SAP workloads on PowerVS. The Secondary Region supports Disaster Recovery systems should the customer have DR requirements . As an alternative, in case of a Cost Optimized DR solution, the Primary Region could support Production workloads on PowerVS while the Secondary Region could support non-Production and Disaster Recovery workloads. The components deployed to the VPC Landing Zone provide security functions and resource isolation to the IBM Cloud workloads.

1.	Client network connectivity from on-premises is accomplished through Direct Link access.
2.	Management network connectivity is accomplished through site-to-site VPN.
3.	A VPC Landing Zone (Edge VPC) is deployed which contains routing and security functions and optional management components for backup, monitoring and user management.
4.	Transit Gateway to Power Virtual Server hosting the SAP application and database(s)
5.	Public connectivity also routes through Cloud Internet Services (CIS) which can provide global load balancing, failover and DDoS services, then routes to the VPC Landing Zone
6.	Global Transit Gateway connecting the PowerVS environment across regions to facilitate replication for DR purposes.



Figure 2 illustrates a detailed architecture for a single-zone, multi-region deployment on IBM Cloud Power Virtual Server.

### Architecture description
{: #architecture-description}

1.	Two separate IBM Cloud regions, one for Primary workload and the other for Disaster Recovery. If Cost Optimized Disaster Recovery is considered, some Non Production systems may share the same compute with Disaster Recovery systems. 
2.	Enterprise network connectivity from On-premise to IBM Cloud is accomplished through Direct Links. 
3.	A VPC Landing Zone (Edge VPC) is deployed which contains routing and security functions.  For security purposes, all ingress and egress traffic will route through the VPC Landing Zone.  It contains a Bastion host (jump), Firewalls providing advanced security functions and the SAP router and SAP Web Dispatcher.  
4.	Besides Power Workloads in Power workspace, x86 workloads may be implemented in a Workload VPC. 
5.	To backup Power workloads, Secure Automated Backup with Compass by Cobalt Iron is implemented. The private end point for this backup service is located in VPC.
6.	VPCs are connected to Power workspace through a local Transit Gateway 
7.	Public connectivity routes through Cloud Internet Services which can provide global load balancing, failover, and DDoS services, then routes to the VPC Landing Zone
8.	SAP workloads may be hosted on redundant SAP certified LPARS in PowerVS 
9.	SAP Application and SAP HANA should be placed on SAP certified LPARs within the zone with proximity considered
10.	Virtual Private endpoints in VPCs are used to provide connectivity to cloud native services 
11.	Global Transit Gateway connecting Power workspace across regions for data replication purposes between the two regions.
12.	To achieve 99.95% infrastructure availability, multiple LPARs in the same placement group within a zone can be implemented



## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

Design decisions that need to be considered for an end-2-end SAP on
PowerVS deployment and which are covered in this accelerator include:

- **Compute:** Virtual Servers
- **Storage:** Primary, Backup, and Archive
- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing
- **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response
- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High Availability
- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Automated Deployment, Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the Architecture
Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro),
provides a consistent approach to designing cloud solutions by
addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and
domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need
to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide
to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure the
applicable requirements for each aspect and domain have been
considered.

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The following represents a baseline set of requirements, which we believe are applicable to most clients and critical to a
successful SAP deployment.

As mentioned earlier, the [Architecture
Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro)
