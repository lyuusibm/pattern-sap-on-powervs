# Architecture decisions for resiliency
{: #resiliency-decisions}

| Architecture decision | Requirement | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----|----|----|
|High Availability SAP                  | Provide 99.95% availability for SAP                   |DB native replication: \n * HANA System Replication (HSR) \n * Oracle DataGuard \n * Db2 HADR \n * Sybase Replication Server \n * MSSQL Always-On \n * Cluster: \n * Pacemaker-based cluster with Red Hat Enterprise Linux HA Add-On, or with SUSE Linux High Availability Extension|Single zone high availability deployment of SAP application and database is supported. Multiple or clustered SAP application servers can be configured.|
|High Availability Infrastructure       | Provide 99.95% availability for infrastructure        |Redundant LPARs in an [SAP Scale-out](/docs/sap?topic=sap-refarch-hana-scaleout#network-layout-for-scale-out-configurations-2) deployment with VPC ALB solution on a single-zone can provide an application SLA of 99.95% | * Minimize cost, implementation and maintenance complexity, potential latency and maximize value with IBM solutions \n * “Different Server” placement group should be chosen to build high availability within the same data center \n * PowerHA can also be implemented for cluster management if AIX is the operating system. |
|Disaster Recovery for SAP on Linux/AIX | Disaster recovery capability in secondary region      | IBM Storage Protect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | * IBM Storage Protect Plus provides near instant recovery and replication in hybrid multi-cloud environments \n * Support for databases Standard lead with offering (MSSQL, Oracle, HANA) \n * Standard DR capability for RPO < 15 min, RTO < 4 hours is achievable \n * Veeam is an alternative for AIX as the operating system

Global replication service is available only in WDC and DAL as of now. It will be available in all PowerVS regions soon.          |
| Disaster Recovery - Cost Optimized    | HANA disaster recovery capability in secondary region | Implement shared processor Pool                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Set up shared processor pool to reserve capacity in the secondary region. Set up DR systems on minimum sized VMs to save operating cost.
